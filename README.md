## Usage

After installing and building the application (see below [Installing Dependencies](#installing-dependencies)), navigate to the login page from the landing page. Here you can register a user and be redirected to the main application.

Once in the main application, the user can view host listings, search for hosts by zip code, and interact with the listings. If you want to find a host, simply find a listing you like and click contact me. This will then provide a prompt to connect with the host via email. If you want to become a host, click the paw print icon in the upper-left navbar to access the form for creating a host listing.

In addition to finding hosts for your pets and hosting your home to watch pets, the user can edit their profile to update user details.

## Requirements

- Node 6.11.0 and higher
- Mongodb latest
- see package.json for dependencies

## Development

### Installing Dependencies

First install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads). Then from within the root directory:

```sh
sudo npm install -g nodemon
npm install
```

Open your favorite terminal and run these commands:

First Tab:
```sh
npm run build
```

Second Tab:

```sh
npm start
```

Webpack bundle.js will be built in:

```sh
src/public/dist/bundle.js
```

This application uses Cloudinary image service for uploading.

You will need to sign up for [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and create an account to use the api. Create a config file for your api object in the following format:

```sh
This is the shape of the object from the config file which is gitignored

 const cloudConfig = {
   cloud_name: 'top-hat',
   api_key: 'API_KEY',
   api_secret: 'API_SECRET'
 };
```

Save this Cloudinary config file as:

```sh
cloudinary/config.js
```

### Testing

Testing is primarily managed through [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](chaijs.com/). Run this command in your terminal:

```sh
npm test
```
